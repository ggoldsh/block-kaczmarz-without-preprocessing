# Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms without Preprocessing

This repository contains code for the experiments in the manuscript "Worth Their Weight: Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms
without Preprocessing," available as a preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00882.

The code consists of two IPython notebooks, one for the experiments with random matrices and the other for the experiments involving natural gradient directions.
The notebooks can be run for example with Jupyter; see https://jupyter.org/install for installation instructions.

To run the experiments with random matrices, you just need a few basic packages: numpy, scipy, tqdm, and matplotlib.

To run the experiments involving natural gradient directions, you will additionally need to install JAX and Flax. See this page for instructions regarding JAX installation https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.
